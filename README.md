The Blacklight CMS
==================

The Blacklight CMS is a Node.js Express plugin which generates websites.   It does so by requesting components  from a Sling data source and rendering those components into HTML.  Blacklight currently provides no facility for editing data in a Sling repository, however that may change in future.

Blacklight developers primarily customize how sites look and behave  by using the following mechanisms:
- Creation of data model processing directives which change/augment incoming Sling data
- Creation of template scripts to render that data into HTML
- Configuration of Express routes to redirect incoming requests
- Creation of rewrite rules to post-process HTML generated by the templates

The basic building block of a Blacklight website is a *component*. Every page is a component, and most pages are themselves made up of multiple sub-components, which in some cases can be nested several levels down. Behind each component is a data model and a template.  A component's data model and template can both be customized by Blacklight developers. The scripts to customize each component's behavior are stored on disk as part of a registry of *component types*.  Each data component coming from Sling is tagged with a *resource type* property, a name which Blacklight uses to find the scripts which describe how to turn the raw Sling data into a data model and how to render it.
